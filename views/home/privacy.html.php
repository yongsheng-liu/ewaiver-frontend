        <h3>Controlling Data and Processing Data </h3>
        <p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
        <p><strong>"User"</strong>: Any individual accessing and/or using the Services through the Customer's account.</p>
        <p><strong>"Participant"</strong>: Any individual whose information is stored on or collected via the Services.</p>
        <p>We do not own, control or direct the use of any of the Participant Data stored or processed by a User via the Service. Only
        the Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Participant Data. WaiverElectronic is largely unaware of what
        Participant Data is actually being stored or made available by a User to the Service and does not directly access such Participant Data except as
        authorized by the User, or as necessary to provide Services to the User.
        </p>
        <p>Because WaiverElectronic does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Participant Data and because it does not determine
        the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, WaiverElectronic is not
        acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter “GDPR”)
        and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR. WaiverElectronic should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Users as to any
        Participant Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, WaiverElectronic does not
        independently cause Participant Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third
        parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of WaiverElectronic in connection with WaiverElectronic’s provision of Services
        to Users. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable User.</p>
        <p>The User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Participant Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal
        Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.</p>
        <p>WaiverElectronic is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Participant Data or other information stored on its servers (or its
        subcontractors’ servers) at the discretion of the User nor is WaiverElectronic responsible for the manner in which the User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or
        otherwise processes such information.</p>
        <p>User has full ownership to their data. User can request to delete or obtain copies of their data at all times even after the termination of the services.</p>
